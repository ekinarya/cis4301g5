# NYC Traffic Tracker

This project revolves around the development of an application that aims to provide users with comprehensive insights into New York City's traffic patterns. Leveraging the extensive dataset collected by the New York City Department of Transportation through automated traffic recorders, our application focuses on delivering in-depth analyses and trends specific to various boroughs, times of the day, and seasonal variations. By integrating real-time traffic data with additional contextual information, we aim to present a holistic understanding of the city's traffic dynamics.

## Motivation

With New York City being a bustling metropolis and a major tourist hub, understanding its traffic trends is vital for both residents and visitors. Our application serves as a valuable tool for city planners, commuters, tourists, and ride-sharing drivers. By providing valuable insights into peak traffic hours, preferred transportation modes, and navigational challenges across different boroughs, users can make informed decisions regarding travel routes, public transportation choices, and residency locations.

## User Interface Functionality

The web-based user interface of the application caters to diverse user needs, allowing for specific inputs such as date ranges and customized trend analysis options. Users can select specific time frames, and even compare trends influenced by external factors such as average income changes and EV usage. The interface boasts interactive and dynamic graphing capabilities, facilitating a user-friendly experience for individuals seeking detailed traffic insights.

## Application Goals

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive analysis of traffic trends, considering factors like average income, street direction changes, vehicle collisions, peak traffic times, we aim to facilitate informed decision-making for commuters and city planners alike.

## Data Description

Our application primarily relies on a rich dataset sourced from the New York City Department of Transportation. This dataset includes detailed traffic records, encompassing information such as borough, date, time, and specific locations of traffic flow. We supplement this primary dataset with additional contextual data, such as electric vehicle use, average income, and vehicle collisions. While the dataset provides a robust foundation for analysis, we remain aware of potential limitations, including incomplete yearly records and variations in data availability across different locations.
